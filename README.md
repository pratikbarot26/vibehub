## 🧪 **Methodology**
  
🏗️ Data Modeling & Integration:
  - Developed Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), and UML models to understand the business requirements and design the backend database.
  - Used MS SQL Server to implement and normalize the database schema.

    
🔍 Data Analysis & Reporting:
  - Power BI Dashboards: Designed interactive dashboards for real-time insights into inventory levels, sales trends, and customer activity.
  - PowerApps Integration: Enabled store managers to update inventory and track transactions through a user-friendly interface.
  - SQL & T-SQL Optimization: Enhanced backend processes with automated scripts for real-time data management and reporting.

     
🚀 Deployment:
  - The system is fully operational, with integration between the database, Power BI, and PowerApps for real-time data updates and reporting.
  - Power BI dashboards offer insights into sales trends, customer activity, and inventory health, while PowerApps enables streamlined management workflows.

## 🔧 **Areas of Improvement**

- Enhanced Automation: Currently, PowerApps does not support triggers, procedures, or other programmability features. Incorporating these capabilities would further streamline operations and reduce manual intervention in real-time data management.
- Additional Features: There are provisions in the database for advanced features such as ratings and insights. Future work could explore implementing these features to provide richer data for analysis and decision-making.
- Scalability: The system’s performance under larger datasets could be further tested, ensuring it remains responsive as the business scales up or as additional stores are added.
- Advanced Data Analytics: Implementing machine learning models for trend prediction (e.g., demand forecasting for rentals) could provide more advanced insights for store managers to optimize inventory and customer service.
